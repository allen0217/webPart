<td><p>Jianzi is a traditional Asian game in which players aim to keep a weighted shuttlecock in the air using mostly their feet and other parts of the body except the hands. The game, which goes by many different names, may be rules-based and be played on a court similar to badminton and volleyball; or it could be played casually among a circle of players in a street or park, with the objective to keep the shuttle in the air and show off skills.

    <td style="padding: 10px 0px 10px 0px;"><p>The origin of the Chinese Hacky Sack (Jianzi) dates back to the Han Dynasty more than 2000 years ago. This game prevailed during the Tang Dynasty (618-907), when shops specializing in shuttlecocks business started to appear. In the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), formal competition of shuttlecock kicking was held. The game continues to evolve and prevail throughout Chinese history. Its lasting popularity is in part credited to its spontaneity. The Chinese Hacky Sack is small and very portable, it requires very little space to play, and it could be played alone or as a group anywhere at any time. The variation of tricks and techniques is countless. Players also enjoy much health benefits along the way.

In June, 1961, a highly successful movie surrounding the sport created another wave of popularity in the country. Elementary schools started incorporating Jianzi in the physical education. The sport eventually made its way to Germany around the 1930’s and has been slowly gaining popularity across the continent since then.
