<div class="subtitle">History about Kites</div>

 <p>Exactly when and how the first kite was invented remains a debatable topic. But thanks to well-preserved written and artistic records, it is widely accepted that the first kite was invented in China over 2000 years ago. Philosopher Mo Di (approx. 468-376 B.C.) made the first kite in the shape of an eagle in the Lo Mountain of Shandong province. According to historical records, early kites were made out of bamboo and silk.

</p>

<p>Right about 200 B.C., Chinese General Han Hsin of the Han Dynasty flew a kite over the walls of an enemy city to measure how far his army would have to tunnel to get passed the enemy defenses. Since then, kites were often applied to military uses, for signaling or spying or even sniping.

</p>

<p>At the turn of the 13th century, the great adventurer Marco Polo brought back to Europe stories about the building and flying of kites in China. But it did not stir much interest.

</p>

<p>Even though kite flying is generally regarded as a family activity, many kite festivals, kite craftsmanship and skill contests, and kite-fighting tournaments are being held all year round internationally. The city of Weifang, located in China Shandong province, is crowned the world Kite Capital, thanks to the exceptional craftsmanship and kite-flying skills of the residents. Every year in April, the World Kite Festival takes place in Weifang, drawing thousands of kite fans from all around the world.
