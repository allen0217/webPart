<div class="subtitle">About the Marco Polo World Foundation Scholarship </div>
<p style="color: White">Marco Polo World Foundation is a non-profit 501(c) (3) organization founded in 2007. We are a non-religious and non-partisan organization with a sole focus of promoting intercultural understanding. Our mission is to introduce to our community the sport of dragon boat racing, and to showcase Asian culture. We launched the Annual DFW Dragon Boat, Kite and Lantern Festival as an effort to pursue our mission, and to celebrate the Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month. Through this festival, we hope to bring together individuals and organizations from all different sectors of the community, and encourage local, regional and international interaction. This year, Marco Polo World Foundation is expanding the effort of pursuing our mission by offering scholarship awards to high school and college students who show dedication to promoting intercultural understanding.</p>
<br />
<div class="subtitle">Description</div>
<p style="color: White">In recognition of student volunteerism in our county, the Marco Polo World Foundation Scholarship Committee has established scholarships for students from high school seniors to the 2nd year college students (full time students) in the greater DFW area.</p>
<br />
<p style="color: White">The Marco Polo World Foundation Scholarships recognize individuals who have made significant contributions to the community through their volunteer efforts. Different from most other scholarships, the Marco Polo World Foundation Scholarships place more emphasis on a student’s demonstrated interest and efforts in serving his/her community than on academic or athletic excellence. It is the goal of the Marco Polo World Foundation to provide opportunities and to encourage students to become active in their community through volunteer service.</p>
