About Marco Polo World Foundation (MPWF)<br />
<br /-->
<p style="color: White">Marco Polo World Foundation is a non-profit 501 (c) (3) organization founded in 2007. We are a non-religious 
and non-partisan organization. Our mission is to promote intercultural understanding and acceptance of diversity in 
the community. We launched the Annual DFW Dragon Boat, Kite and Lantern Festival as an effort to pursue our mission, 
as well as to showcase international culture and to celebrate Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month. Marco Polo World 
Foundation provides four programs: (1) the Annual DFW Dragon Boat, Kite and Lantern Festival, (2) scholarships, 
(3) internships, and (4) membership. Through these programs, we aim to bring together individuals and organizations 
from different sectors of the community, and encourage local, regional and international interaction. The MPWF 
scholarship is awarded to students who show dedication to promoting intercultural understanding and serving the 
community through volunteerism. For more information about the scholarship and our other programs, please visit us 
on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or our website at www.dfwdragonboatfestival.com. We encourage individuals and 
organizations to donate funds or sponsorships to the foundation so that we can continue to provide family fun, 
educational, wellness, intercultural and other programs that benefit the community.</p>
