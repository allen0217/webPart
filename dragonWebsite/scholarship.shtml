<div class="subtitle">About the Marco Polo World Foundation Scholarship </div>
<p style="color: White">Marco Polo World Foundation is a non-profit 501 (c) (3) organization founded in 2007. We are a non-religious and non-partisan organization. Our mission is to promote intercultural understanding and acceptance of diversity in the community. We launched the Annual DFW Dragon Boat, Kite and Lantern Festival as an effort to pursue our mission, as well as to showcase international culture and to celebrate Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month. Through this festival, we hope to bring together individuals and organizations from all different sectors of the community, and encourage local, regional and international interaction. MPWF is expanding the effort of pursuing our mission by offering scholarship awards to high school seniors and college  underclassmen  who show dedication to promoting intercultural understanding.</p>
<br />
<div class="subtitle">Description</div>
<p style="color: White">In recognition of student volunteerism in our community, the Marco Polo World Foundation (MPWF) has established scholarships for students from public high school seniors with acceptance to public universities in hand  through  2nd year college students (full time students) in the greater DFW area.</p>
<br />
<p style="color: White">The MPWF Scholarships recognize individuals who have made significant contributions to the community through their volunteer efforts and in multi-cultural activities. Different from most other scholarships, the MPWF Scholarships place more emphasis on a student's demonstrated interest and efforts in serving his/her community than on academic or athletic excellence. It is the goal of the MPWF to provide opportunities and to encourage students to become active in their community through volunteer service.</p>

<p style="color: White">The Marco Polo World Foundation Scholarships has been founded since year 2012 through funding contributions from regional businesses. </p>
