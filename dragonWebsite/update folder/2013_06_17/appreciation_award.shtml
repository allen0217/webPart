<strong>Grandmaster Johnny Kwong Ming Lee</strong><br /></p>

<p style="color: White">

Grandmaster Johnny Kwong Ming Lee or Lee Kwong Ming was born in Shanghai, China.  In 1958, his family moved to Hong Kong, where, at the age of 12, he began studying Northern Shaolin My Jhong Law Horn Kung Fu under the late Grandmaster Yip Yu-Ting.  Master Yip was a respected and recognized member of the Four Supreme Excellent Masters of Hopei, China.  He took Master Lee as his last personal student.  In 1965 Master Lee became the personal student of the late General Sun Paul Kung.  General Sun was a disciple of Grandmaster Fu Chen Sung, one of the original "Five Tigers" from Northern China.  He taught Master Lee internal Kung Fu, Dragon Style Pa Kua Chang, Chi Kung and Wu Style Tai Chi.  Master Lee also became the personal indoor student of the late Grandmaster Ma Yueh Liang, the Chinese Martial Arts national treasure of Wu Style Tai Chi in Shanghai. In 1974 Master Lee moved to the U.S. where he became one of the first Chinese masters to introduce the traditional Chinese Martial Arts into mainstream America. Master Lee has been featured in many national Martial Arts magazines and has appeared on the covers of <span style="font-style: italic">Tai Chi Magazine, Internal Arts and Journal of Chinese Martial Arts.  Internal Arts </span>magazine recognized him as one of the most knowledgeable masters of Pa Kua Chang in this country.  Inside <span style="font-style: italic">Kung Fu </span>magazine called him a nationally respected instructor of the Chinese Martial Arts and Pa Kua Journal said he was one of the two best-known Fu Style Pa Kua masters in the United States. He was also named Instructor of the Year and inducted into the Black Belt Hall of Fame.  In 1998 he co directed, with Jeff Bolt, the World Kung Fu/Wushu World Championships in Orlando, one of the largest International Kung Fu tournaments held in America.  This tournament was shown on ESPN. On January 8, 2006, the title of 10th Degree Black Belt Grandmaster of Traditional Kung Fu was bestowed upon Master Lee by the World Organization of Wushu and Kung Fu Masters at a ceremony in Hong Kong.  He is now one of ten in the world who have received the rank of this level. The high degree of proficiency of Master Lee's teaching skills, applications of technique and theoretical insight into the Chinese Martial Arts, both internal and external, are best demonstrated through his students.  They excel in national and world tournaments and hold many championship titles in forms, sparring and push hands. The headquarters of Lee's White Leopard National Association is in Dallas, Texas.  The branches of his schools are in, Louisiana, Florida, Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee.
