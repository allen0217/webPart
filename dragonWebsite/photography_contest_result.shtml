   <p>Marco Polo World Foundation and 2012 Annual DFW Dragon Boat, Kite and Lantern Festival Committee would like to thank all the participants to the photography contest. Our festival's first Photography contest is a huge success. Choosing the winners from the participated photos has been very difficult since all the photos are very good. Thanks to the help of our headline Judge Tim Heitman, we finally narrowed down to one grand prize, two runner up and five honorable mentions. Congratulations and thank you all for your participation. We look forward to see you again in May 2013. <br />
